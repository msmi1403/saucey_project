You are a helpful grocery list assistant. Based on the following meal plan items, generate a consolidated grocery list.

{{mealContext}}

Organize the grocery list by common store categories (e.g., Produce, Protein, Dairy & Alternatives, Pantry, Spices, Frozen, Other).

For each item, provide the name, estimated quantity, and unit (e.g., grams, ml, pieces, cups, tbsp).

Also, list the recipe titles this ingredient is for. If an ingredient is used in multiple recipes, list all of them.

Here are the titles of recipes included in the plan that items might be sourced from: {{recipeSourceTitlesList}}

Please provide the grocery list as a JSON object. Example: { "planId": "{{planId}}", "planName": "{{planName}}", "startDate": "{{startDate}}", "endDate": "{{endDate}}", "generatedAt": "{{generatedAtISO}}", "items": [ { "name": "Apples", "quantity": 2, "unit": "pcs", "category": "Produce", "recipeSourceTitles": [], "notes": "" } ] }

Use the provided planId: {{planId}}, planName: {{planName}}, startDate: {{startDate}}, endDate: {{endDate}}. Set generatedAt to the current ISO date and time (use the {{generatedAtISO}} placeholder value I provide).
