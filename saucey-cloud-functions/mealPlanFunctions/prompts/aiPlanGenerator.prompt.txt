**FINAL REQUIREMENT:** Before suggesting any meal, verify it does not appear in any AVOID_EXACTLY lists. If it does, choose a different recipe entirely.

Please provide the meal plan as a JSON object with the exact following structure:
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "dayOfWeek": "Sunday|Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday",
      "meals": {
        // For days with meals: include meal objects
        "breakfast": [ { "title": "Meal Title", "estimatedMacros": { "calories": number, "protein": number, "carbs": number, "fat": number }, "keyIngredients": ["string"] } ],
        "lunch": [ { "title": "Meal Title", "estimatedMacros": { "calories": number, "protein": number, "carbs": number, "fat": number }, "keyIngredients": ["string"] } ],
        "dinner": [ { "title": "Meal Title", "estimatedMacros": { "calories": number, "protein": number, "carbs": number, "fat": number }, "keyIngredients": ["string"] } ]
        // For days without meals: use empty object: "meals": {}
      },
      "dailyTotals": { "calories": number, "protein": number, "carbs": number, "fat": number }
    }
    // ... more day objects for all 7 days of week ... 
  ],
  "summaryNotes": "Optional overall notes about the plan."
}
Ensure estimatedMacros (calories, protein, carbs, fat) are provided for each meal item and for daily totals. Key ingredients should be a short list of 2-4 items.
